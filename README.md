# Advanced Java + Quarkus + Spring Boot Extension Collection

This extension pack combines the most frequently used and some of the most helpful VSCode Java, Quarkus, and Spring Boot extensions. It's perfectly fine if you don't require all of them.

Note that I have included two free AI tools, Phind and Codeium. Feel free to choose the ones you prefer!

The items do not necessarily stay in order of importance. If you have suggestions for other extensions, please send me a message.
